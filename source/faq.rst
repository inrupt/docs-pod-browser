Why don't I have access to browse my Pod?
=========================================

You must log into your Solid Pod and add PodBrowser as a trusted
application with ``Read``, ``Write``, ``Append``, and ``Control``
access to manage your Solid Pod.

#. Log into your Solid Pod.

#. Go to the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab.

#. In the :guilabel:`Manage your trusted applications` section, add
   PodBrowser to the table:

   .. list-table::

      * - Application URL

        - Access modes

      * - ``https://podbrowser.inrupt.com``

        - ``Read``, ``Write``, ``Append``, and ``Control``
